# Odin Project #2 - Landing Page (HTML - CSS)

## This is a static mockup page using HTML and CSS, there is not functionability to it.

This project was built to help me solidify concepts learned through the Odin Project curriculum. I use HTML and CSS to style the mockup page and some concepts that I learned and used are: 

- HTML:
    - Layout structure.
    - HTML boilertemplate.
    - Embed CSS from an external sheet.
    - Semantic elements header, main, footer, section, article tags.
    - Divs, paragraphs, span, buttons, html entity (&#169).
    - Place images and hyperlinks with anchor and img tags.
- CSS:
    - Universal selector.
    - Inline elements
    - Element selectors, class selectors, descendant selectors.
    - Box model-- block, inline, inline-block elements, margin, paddings width and height, flex.
    - Flex properties and values-- justify-content, align-items, flex.
    - Properties and values types-- number, length, keywords, colors, percentages.
